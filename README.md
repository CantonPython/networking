Networking Examples

First things, first: This is an introduction to networking with Python3.

Each subdirectory may contain a series of folders (1, 2, etc.) based on a modular building and testing iteration.

For example, look in epicd (epic webserver src code) and you will find 4 iterations to get to a final version (is anything in code really the "final" version?).

Running diff against each previous folder should give a sense of what additions have been made.

Jump to folder epicd/4 and execute the following:

  $ python3 -i -m epicd

Now, you can check the progress of this epic web game from your browser:

  http://localhost:8080
  
To see the final version run and connect clients to this EPIC networking game, execute:

  $
